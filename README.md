Getting back up to speed with Ruby and Rails!

Starting off with a basic online store template.

Features targeted right now:

1. User login
   - browse products, add to cart, checkout flow
2. Admin login
   -  manage products, view orders
3. Guest login
   - add item to cart as guest
   - checkout as guest


To compile scss, run `bin/dev`. This will launch the rails server and watch for changes in the scss files.
If you aren't working in scss or need to debug the rails server, just run `rails s` as usual.
