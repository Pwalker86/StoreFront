- Affordable pricing:
  - All features required for a business are included
  - We default to the lowest price possible, but leave the choice to the business owner in the end

To compile scss, run `bin/dev`. This will launch the rails server and watch for changes in the scss files.
If you aren't working in scss or need to debug the rails server, just run `rails s` as usual.
